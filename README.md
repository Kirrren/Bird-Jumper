# Bird-Jumper
a redesign of a game I made in middle school, now in unity. Yes it kinda really bad, ik.

all of the coding data is stored and can be accessed from the game code file, though if you just want to play it, u only need to download the folder with the build data for your os (Windows, etc.)

Im lazy, so thats it for this read me
